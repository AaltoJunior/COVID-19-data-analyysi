It can be in many different types of data for example spreadsheets, text, audio or photos. Data can be static or dynamic. In this analysis, we use data dynamically published by WHO. This data is in spreadsheet form and it's [publicly available](https://covid19.who.int/table) under their [licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/igo/) this allows us to utilize this data. This data has covid recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths for the whole world. Remember to always check usage rights to the data being used.\n","\n","In this practice, you have the data ready in a very functional form. This is great since now we can focus on the data analysis and conclusions. Only minimal data cleanup is required here.\n","\n","The data can be downloaded in multiple file formats. In this practice, the data is in CSV format. You can learn more about CSV format [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). From the data, we can find out new COVID-19 cases and deaths organized by country and date. The data also includes [WHO Regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WHO_regions).\n","\n","**Programming**\n","\n","There are numerous modules available for python. They can be used to add more functionality to the code and to expand the feature set of python. In this practice, we utilise the pandas module for the data analysis and later on matplotlib for data visualization. The data given to us is in CSV format. We start by converting it to pandas.DataFrame format that can be used with the pandas module.\n","\n","For this practice, the code is mostly already written for you. You can edit and add code to the already written code and run them in the code boxes by clicking the play symbol or pressing Shift+Enter.
